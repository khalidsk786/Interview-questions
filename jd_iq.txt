1. What scripting languages are you familiar with?
shell& Python

2. What are artifacts in GitLab CI?
Artifacts are the files or folders saved after a job finishes in GitLab CI.

3. What is a private module registry in Terraform?
It’s a private place to store and share Terraform modules within your organization — so teams can reuse code securely.
module "vpc" {
  source  = "app/vpc/aws"
  version = "1.0.0"
}
----------------------
4. If you delete the local Terraform state file and it's not stored in S3 or DynamoDB, how can you recover it?
You cannot recover it automatically.
You will need to:
Manually import each resource using terraform import
or
Recreate the infrastructure and state file from scratch.
✅ To avoid this in future, always use remote state storage (S3 + DynamoDB).

5. How do you import resources into Terraform?
terraform import <RESOURCE_TYPE>.<RESOURCE_NAME> <RESOURCE_ID>

6. What is a dynamic block in Terraform?
A dynamic block is used to generate repeated nested blocks in Terraform using a loop — helpful when you want to create multiple similar configurations without repeating code.

variable "ports" {
  default = [80, 443]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example-sg"

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.ports
    content {
      from_port   = ingress.value
      to_port     = ingress.value
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  }
}

7. How can you create EC2 instances in two different AWS accounts simultaneously using Terraform?
# Provider for Account 1
provider "aws" {
  alias   = "account1"
  region  = "us-east-1"
  profile = "account1-profile"
}

# Provider for Account 2
provider "aws" {
  alias   = "account2"
  region  = "us-west-2"
  profile = "account2-profile"
}

# EC2 in Account 1
resource "aws_instance" "ec2_account1" {
  provider = aws.account1
  ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

# EC2 in Account 2
resource "aws_instance" "ec2_account2" {
  provider = aws.account2
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

8. How do you handle an error stating that the resource already exists when creating resources with Terraform?
-----------------
terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <resource_id>
terraform state mv ab to abcdef
9. How does Terraform refresh work?
If someone changed a resource manually in AWS, terraform refresh will update the state to reflect that change — but won’t apply or modify anything.

10. How would you upgrade Terraform plugins?
-------
terraform init -upgrade

11. What are the different types of Kubernetes volumes?
Use emptyDir for temp data.

Use PVC with EBS for production databases.

Use configMap/secret to inject configs or credentials.
--------------------------------------------
12. If a pod is in a crash loop, what might be the reasons, and how can you recover it?
-------------------
kubectl logs <pod-name>  
| Reason                           | Example                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Wrong command or script**    | The `command:` or `entrypoint:` in the container exits immediately or has an error |
| ⚠️ **Missing dependency**        | App needs a service (like DB), but it's not ready                                  |
| 📦 **Bad image or version**      | The image has bugs, is misconfigured, or not built correctly                       |
| 🔑 **Missing config or secret**  | The app can't find required env vars or volumes                                    |
| 🔌 **Port conflict**             | App is trying to bind to a port already in use                                     |
| 📈 **Resource limits too tight** | App gets killed due to CPU/memory constraints (OOMKilled)                          |

13. What is the difference between StatefulSet and DaemonSet?
| Feature      | **StatefulSet**                                            | **DaemonSet**                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Purpose   | Deploy **stateful** apps (needs stable identity)           | Run **one pod per node** (like agents or logs)              |
| 🆔 Pod Names | Pods get **unique, stable names** (e.g., `web-0`, `web-1`) | All pods have same name pattern, one on **each node**       |
| 📦 Storage   | Can use **persistent volumes** that stick to each pod      | Usually **no storage** or uses hostPath                     |
| 🔄 Pod Order | Creates and deletes pods **in order**                      | No specific order needed                                    |
| 🔁 Scaling   | Scales with **replica count** (e.g., 3 replicas)           | **Auto runs on all nodes** (no replicas needed)             |
| 💡 Use Case  | Databases (e.g., MySQL, Kafka, Cassandra)                  | Monitoring agents (e.g., Fluentd, Prometheus Node Exporter) |

14. What is a sidecar container in Kubernetes, and what are its use cases?
----------
A sidecar container is a helper container that runs in the same Pod as your main application container.

➡️ They share the same network, storage, and lifecycle.

Think of it like a co-driver (sidecar) riding with your main app — supporting it behind the scenes.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: my-app-image
    - name: sidecar-logger
      image: log-collector

15. If pods fail to start during a rolling update, what strategy would you use to identify the issue and rollback?
---------
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment-name>
kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>

16. How can we enable communication between 500 AWS accounts internally?
---------
1. Use AWS Transit Gateway (Best Approach)
Create a Transit Gateway in a central/shared networking account.
Share the TGW with other accounts using Resource Access Manager (RAM).
In each account:Attach VPCs to the TGW
Scales well for 500+ accounts
Centralized and secure communication
2. Use VPC Peering (Not Recommended for 500)
Create VPC peering connections between VPCs across accounts.
Update route tables to enable traffic.
Update route tables to route traffic via TGW.

17. How to configure a solution where a Lambda function triggers on an S3 upload and updates DynamoDB?
-----------
How to trigger Lambda on S3 upload and update DynamoDB:
Create an S3 bucket to receive files.

Create a Lambda function with code to update DynamoDB.

Add S3 trigger to the Lambda (on ObjectCreated event).

Give permissions to Lambda to read S3 and write to DynamoDB.
------
18. What is the standard port for RDP?
------------
Port 3389
19. How do you configure a Windows EC2 instance to join an Active Directory domain?###
20. How can you copy files from a Linux server to an S3 bucket?
---------
aws s3 cp /path/to/folder s3://your-bucket-name/ --recursive

21. What permissions do you need to grant for that S3 bucket?
------------
To upload files, you need:

s3:PutObject → to upload

s3:PutObjectAcl → if setting permissions

s3:ListBucket → to view contents (optional)
22. What are the different types of VPC endpoints and when do you use them?
🧠 Easy to Remember:
Type	Use For	Cost	Example Use
Interface:	Most AWS services	Paid	EC2 → SNS, SQS, etc.
Gateway:	S3, DynamoDB only	Free	EC2 → S3 privately
GWLB:	Security appliances	Paid	EC2 traffic → firewall endpoint

23. How to resolve an image pullback error when using an Alpine image pushed to ECR in a pipeline?
Check image → Check tag → IAM → ECR login → Network → Retry

24. What is the maximum size of an S3 object?
--------
5TB
25. What encryption options do we have in S3?
-------------
 Easy Tip to Remember:(Server-Side Encryption with S3-managed keys)
SSE-S3 → Simple,
SSE-KMS → Secure & auditable,
SSE-C → You control,
Client-side → You encrypt before upload
26. Can you explain IAM user, IAM role, and IAM group in AWS?
IAM User
A user represents a person or application.

It has long-term credentials (like username & password or access keys).

IAM Role

A role is used to grant temporary access to AWS services.

It has no credentials by default — you assume a role.

Used by EC2, Lambda, or cross-account access.

IAM Group

A group is a collection of users.

You attach policies to a group, and all users in that group get the permissions.


27. What is the difference between an IAM role and an IAM policy document?
---------------------------
 IAM Role
An identity you can assume to get temporary access to AWS resources.

Used by EC2, Lambda, users, or other services.

Does not have long-term credentials.

Example: A role that allows EC2 to access S3.

🔹 IAM Policy Document
--------------------------
A JSON document that defines what actions are allowed or denied.

It is attached to roles, users, or groups.

It tells what resources can be accessed and what actions are allowed.

------------
28. What are inline policies and managed policies?

Inline Policies
A policy directly attached to one user, group, or role.

It’s embedded — only works with that identity.

Harder to reuse or manage.

🧠 Think: Custom rule written only for one person.

🔹 Managed Policies
Standalone policies you can attach to multiple users, groups, or roles.

Two types:

AWS-managed (created by AWS)

Customer-managed (you create)

Easier to reuse and manage centrally.

🧠 Think: Reusable rulebook shared across teams.
----------------------------------------------------
29. How can we add a load balancer to Route 53?
---------------------
Steps to Add an ELB (Load Balancer) to Route 53:
Create a Load Balancer

Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) in your AWS account.

Get the DNS name of the Load Balancer

Looks like:
my-loadbalancer-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

Go to Route 53 → Hosted Zones

Create a Record

Type: A record (or Alias type)

Name: e.g., app.example.com

Alias Target: Choose the load balancer from the drop-down

Save the record
--------------------
30. What are A records and CNAME records?   
A Record
Maps a domain name to an IP address.

Example:
example.com → 192.0.2.1

✅ CNAME Record
Maps a domain name to another domain name.

Example:
www.example.com → example.com
------------
31. What is the use of a target group in a load balancer?
A target group is used to route traffic from the load balancer to one or more registered targets (like EC2 instances, Lambda, or IPs).
-------------------
32. If a target group is unhealthy, what might be the reasons?
Always check:
Health check config
Target status
Security groups
App logs
----------------
33. Can you share your screen and write a Jenkins pipeline?
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone Code') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/sample-app.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                // e.g., sh 'npm install' or 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                // e.g., sh 'npm test' or 'pytest'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'
                // e.g., call a script or kubectl apply
            }
        }
    }
}

34. How do you write parallel jobs in a Jenkins pipeline?

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Parallel Tasks') {
            parallel {
                stage('Test on Chrome') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Running tests on Chrome...'
                    }
                }

                stage('Test on Firefox') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Running tests on Firefox...'
                    }
                }

                stage('Lint Code') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Linting code...'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
