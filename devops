Terraform Variables concepts

Declare Variables:
------------------

Declare variables within your Terraform configurations using the variable block. Specify the variable name, type, and default value (if applicable).

Reference Variables:
--------------------
Reference variables throughout your Terraform configuration using interpolation syntax ${var.variable_name}. This allows you to access the values of variables and use them within resource definitions, expressions, or modules.

Input Variable Values:
---------------------
Input variable values can be provided via various methods, including command-line flags, environment variables, or variable definition files. This allows for dynamic configuration based on different environments or deployment scenarios.
