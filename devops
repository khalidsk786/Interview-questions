Terraform Variables concepts

Declare Variables:
------------------

Declare variables within your Terraform configurations using the variable block. Specify the variable name, type, and default value (if applicable).

Reference Variables:
--------------------
Reference variables throughout your Terraform configuration using interpolation syntax ${var.variable_name}. This allows you to access the values of variables and use them within resource definitions, expressions, or modules.

Input Variable Values:
---------------------
Input variable values can be provided via various methods, including command-line flags, environment variables, or variable definition files. This allows for dynamic configuration based on different environments or deployment scenarios.

10 Terraform Scenario Questions Every DevOps Engineer Should Know

1) What happens if your state file is accidentally deleted?
Answer: Terraform loses track of all managed infrastructure. On next apply, it will attempt to recreate everything from scratch, potentially causing conflicts with existing resources.

2) What happens if multiple team members run terraform apply simultaneously?
Answer: State file locking fails, risking corrupted state and inconsistent infrastructure. One process succeeds while others error out, potentially leading to drift if not managed properly.

 3) What happens if a resource fails halfway through a terraform apply?
Answer: Terraform leaves successfully created resources running but marks the state as tainted. Subsequent apply operations will attempt to recreate failed resources, but you're left in partial state.

4) What happens when AWS API rate limits are hit during a large terraform apply?
Answer: Operations fail with throttling errors. Terraform retries a few times then fails the apply. Resources created before the limit was hit remain, creating partial deployments.

 5) What happens if terraform plan shows no changes but infrastructure was modified outside Terraform?
Answer: Terraform won't detect the drift until you run terraform refresh or terraform plan -refresh-only. This can lead to unexpected behavior when making future changes.
6) What happens if you delete a resource definition from your configuration?
Answer: On next apply, Terraform will destroy that resource in your infrastructure unless you use terraform state rm to remove it from state first or use lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }.

7) What happens if a provider API changes between Terraform versions?
Answer: You may encounter compatibility issues and failed plans/applies. Resources might need to be rebuilt or configurations updated to match new API requirements.

 8) What happens if you have circular dependencies in your Terraform modules?
Answer: Terraform will fail to initialize or plan with dependency cycle errors. You'll need to refactor your module structure to break the circular references.

9) What happens if you exceed AWS service quotas during deployment?
Answer: Resources will fail to create with quota exceeded errors. Terraform marks them as failed, and you'll need to request quota increases before retrying the apply.

10) What happens if you lose access to the remote backend storing your state?
Answer: All Terraform operations fail until access is restored. Teams can't collaborate, and changes can't be applied safely. This effectively blocks all infrastructure changes.

Highlighting Questions faced in Cognizant interview yesterday
 
What is connection drain
Backend.tf file is showing in repo but it is not showing in storage account, what may be the issue
How to login VM if VM has private IP
You have deployed a web app and it was working fine but application went down, and all networking are fine and related ports are open, how to troubleshoot
Types of load balancers
What is Az App Gateway and how it encrypt http/https traffic
App is down and throwing 503 err code, what steps should be taken
--------- Answers for above questions
For 2 question it may be because

1. Terraform init was not initialised in first place for backend.tf due to which its showing in repo but not in storage acc.
2. If it was initialised, may be it got stored locally. If terraform.tfstate exists locally, Terraform is not using remote storage.
3. If Terraform is actively running, the state might be locked by a .lock file.
----
this is what I can think of, any other answers/corrections will be appreciated
Also for question 4 is the answer the below?
Check the status of nginx/apache service that was used to host the web app
Check if any firewall/security group rules are blocking the flow of traffic
Ping/telnet won't make sense since networking side is fine
Clearing cache/cookies from browser for stale enteries
Do nslookup for dns resolution if that works fine
Check SSL certificate if it has gone corrupt and is working fine
Lack of memory on the web app server due to which it is failing to load the resources for the app

 Can you please help answers for these questions 10.explain kubernets architecture 
11.commands used in kubernets 
12.if application which you are trying to deploy with kubernets got crashed and you are not able to enter into pod what will be your approach 
13.explain about your project pipeline
14.have you worked on production deployment activity ?
15.how frequently do we deploy to production in your current project

10th Answer:
10.explain Kubernetes architecture: Kubernetes consists of two planes 1. Master 2. worker. Master Plane consists of an API server which is the main component of the Master node. It is the main component that interacts with the kubectl. ETCD contains all the information related to the pods. The scheduler will help to schedule the pods on the nodes based on the conditions(node selector, node affinity, taint&toleration). The controller which acts similarly tfstate file in Terraform, has complete information on the current state of pods. Worker nodes consist of kubelet which is the main component of the worker node it gets the info from the API server to schedule the pods. The container runtime helps to run the containers based on the information received from kubelet. The kubeproxy mainly deals with networking.

11th Answer:
11.commands used in kubernets 1. Kubectl apply -f <filename> 2. Kunectl get nodes 3. kubectl get pods -o wide 4. kubectl get svc 5. kubectl get rs 6. kubectl create ns <name> 7. kubectl get logs <podname> 8. kubectl exec -it <podname> -- /bin/bash 9. kubectl label nodes <label_key>=<lable_value>

Explain the disaster recovery plan which you use in your project?

@everyone 

An interesting questions to you all, let's see how many of you thought about it ?

You all must have tried `ssh-keygen` atleast once to generate `ssh keys`, Question is - What happens when you provide a password instead of using empty passphrase ?
Ans:I think If you give a password while using ssh-keygen, it locks the private key. You'll need to enter that password every time you use the key for SSH. This adds extra security.

Answers:-

L1 Questions (Beginner Level)

1️⃣ In Git, explain the push and pull commands.
    •    git push uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
    •    git pull fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local branch.

2️⃣ What is the use of Git tags?
    •    Git tags mark specific points in the repository’s history, often used for version releases (e.g., v1.0).

3️⃣ What are the different types of branches in Git?
    •    Main/Master Branch: The production-ready branch.
    •    Feature Branch: For developing new features.
    •    Develop Branch: Integration branch for new features before merging into the main branch.
    •    Release Branch: Prepares stable code for release.
    •    Hotfix Branch: For urgent fixes in production.

4️⃣ How do you write an Ansible playbook, and what client requirements do you consider?
    •    A playbook is a YAML file defining tasks to be executed on remote servers.
    •    Considerations: OS compatibility, dependencies, idempotency, user permissions, and rollback strategies.

- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt: 
        name: nginx
        state: present

5️⃣ In Python, what are lists and tuples, and how do they differ?
    •    Lists: Mutable, dynamic, and defined using [].
    •    Tuples: Immutable, faster, and defined using ().

6️⃣ In CloudWatch, what is the use of log groups and log trails?
    •    Log Groups: Logical containers for log streams from different services.
    •    Log Trails: Capture and store API activity for auditing (linked with CloudTrail).

7️⃣ In Terraform, what is the purpose of init, plan, and apply commands?
    •    terraform init → Initializes the working directory.
    •    terraform plan → Shows what changes will be made.
    •    terraform apply → Applies the changes to the infrastructure.
-----------
L2 Questions (Advanced Level)

1️⃣ What are Network ACLs and Security Groups, and how do they differ?
    •    Network ACLs: Stateless, applied at the subnet level, allow/deny specific traffic.
    •    Security Groups: Stateful, applied at the instance level, allow only permitted traffic.

2️⃣ Explain EC2 instances and handling multiple VPCs.
    •    EC2 instances are virtual servers in AWS. Multiple VPCs can be connected using VPC peering or Transit Gateway.

3️⃣ How do you configure AWS RDS, and what factors do you consider?
    •    Factors: Instance size, storage type (GP2/IO1), backup retention, multi-AZ, read replicas, and security settings.

4️⃣ How much data is stored in your RDS MySQL?
    •    Use SELECT table_schema AS DB, SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024 AS SIZE_MB FROM information_schema.tables GROUP BY table_schema;

5️⃣ How many masters and slaves are in RDS?
    •    RDS uses one primary instance (master) and multiple replicas (read replicas for read scalability).

7️⃣ What kind of CI/CD pipelines are you familiar with?
    •    Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, AWS CodePipeline, ArgoCD.

8️⃣ Explain Declarative vs. Scripting pipelines.
    •    Declarative Pipelines: Define the pipeline as code using YAML or JSON (e.g., Jenkinsfile).
    •    Scripting Pipelines: Use scripting (e.g., Bash, Python) to define steps dynamically.

9️⃣ In Kubernetes, if a pod is in a pending state, how do you troubleshoot?
    •    Check pod status (kubectl get pods), describe pod (kubectl describe pod <pod-name>), check events (kubectl get events).

🔟 If Docker containers are consuming too much disk space, how do you fix it?
    •    Run docker system prune to clean unused containers, images, and volumes.
