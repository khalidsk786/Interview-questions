Interviewers typically tailor their questions based on a candidate's resume and the job role's requirements. If a job requires Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and the candidate has those skills listed, they should be prepared for in-depth questions about those technologies. However, if those skills are not on their resume, it's unlikely that the interviewer will focus on them.

A good approach is to carefully analyze the job description, match it with your experience, and prepare accordingly. If you’re applying for Azure DevOps roles, expect questions on CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform/Bicep, monitoring, security, and automation. If Kubernetes and Docker are part of the job description, then brushing up on those topics is essential.

I understand your frustration with attending multiple interviews and not getting selected. From my experience, MNCs tend to have a more structured interview process. They usually focus on your introduction, past experience, and skills, and their questions are aligned with what you’ve actually worked on. This makes it easier to showcase your strengths.

On the other hand, smaller companies or startups often ask a wide range of questions across different topics because they prefer candidates who can handle multiple roles. This can make the interview process more unpredictable.

My suggestion is to target MNCs, where the interviews are generally more aligned with your expertise. This approach might improve your chances of selection.
