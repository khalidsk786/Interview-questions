**"How do you store secrets?"**, 

they are looking to understand your approach to securely managing sensitive information (like API keys, database credentials, etc.) in your applications. Here's how you can structure your answer:

---

### **1. General Approach to Storing Secrets**
Start by explaining the importance of securely managing secrets:
- **"Secrets are sensitive pieces of information, such as API keys, database credentials, or certificates, that need to be securely stored and accessed by applications. To ensure security, I avoid hardcoding secrets in application code or configuration files and instead use a centralized secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault."**

---

### **2. Why Use a Secret Management Tool?**
Explain why you use a tool like Vault:
- **"I use a secret management tool like HashiCorp Vault because it provides encryption at rest, dynamic secret generation, access control through policies, and audit logging. This ensures that secrets are securely stored, rotated, and accessed only by authorized applications or users."**

---

 **3. How You Store Secrets in Vault**
Describe the process of storing secrets in Vault:
- **"In Vault, I enable the KV (Key-Value) secrets engine to store static secrets like database credentials. For example, I store secrets at paths like `secret/data/myapp/config` with key-value pairs such as `username` and `password`. These secrets are encrypted and can only be accessed by applications or users with the appropriate policies."**

---

**4. How Applications Access Secrets**
Explain how applications retrieve secrets securely:
- **"In Kubernetes, I use Vault's Agent Injector to inject secrets directly into application pods. This is done by annotating the pod or deployment YAML with the required secret paths and templates. Vault then injects the secrets as environment variables or files into the pod, ensuring the application can securely access them without directly interacting with Vault."**



 **5. Example Workflow**
Provide a brief example:
- **"For example, in a Kubernetes deployment, I annotate the pod with the secret path (`secret/data/myapp/config`) and a template for how the secret should be formatted. Vault injects the secret into the pod as a file, such as a database connection string, which the application reads at runtime. This ensures that secrets are not hardcoded or exposed in the source code."**

---

 **6. Common Practices for Secret Management**
Mention best practices:
- **"I follow best practices for secret management, such as:**
  1. **Using short-lived dynamic secrets** (e.g., database credentials generated by Vault).
  2. **Implementing role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure only authorized applications or users can access specific secrets.
  3. **Enabling audit logging** to track who accessed which secrets and when.
  4. **Regularly rotating secrets** to minimize the impact of potential leaks."

---

**7. If Asked About Alternatives**
If they ask about alternatives to Vault, mention other tools:
- **"Other tools I’ve used or I am familiar with include AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Kubernetes Secrets. However, Vault is my preferred choice because of its flexibility, support for dynamic secrets, and integration with multiple platforms."**

---

**Sample Answer**
Here’s how you can combine all the points into a concise answer:

**"To securely store secrets, I use a centralized secret management tool like HashiCorp Vault. Vault encrypts secrets at rest and provides fine-grained access control through policies. For example, I store static secrets like database credentials in the KV secrets engine at paths like `secret/data/myapp/config`. 

In Kubernetes, I use Vault's Agent Injector to inject secrets directly into application pods as files or environment variables. This ensures that secrets are not hardcoded in the application code or configuration files. 

Additionally, I follow best practices like role-based access control, audit logging, and regular secret rotation to enhance security."**

Hi everyone, I'm Sneha! 

Just wanted to share some real interview questions I’ve faced recently for NUOS INFO Systems — mainly around Terraform, Azure, DevOps, Docker, and Git. These could help you with prep or spark some discussion. Feel free to add your thoughts too!

 Terraform & Azure:

How do you scale a Terraform pipeline that takes 25+ mins?

What happens to the Terraform state file if someone deletes resources from Azure?

If the pipeline fails due to existing resources, how do you handle RIP (Remove, Import, Plan)?

How do you export Azure resources into Terraform code?

How do you enforce Azure Policies (like tag or location restrictions) using Terraform at scale?

 DevOps & CI/CD:

Best practices to structure repos and pipelines in a large DevOps project?

Pipeline fails only on Tuesdays, no code changes — how do you debug?

Logs are incomplete — how would you troubleshoot across AKS, Ingress, App, and Infra?

How to monitor Azure VM memory and alert if it crosses 80%?

 Docker & Tools:

How to write a multistage Dockerfile for a Node.js app — removing secrets and unnecessary layers?

Recommended tools for CI/CD, artifact storage, vulnerability scanning, and container registry in a hybrid (on-prem + Azure) setup?

 Migration & Security:

How do you assess Azure DevOps migration readiness and plan the transition?

How do you manage AWS + Azure using a single DevOps process with focus on security & cost?

How would you use Azure DevOps REST API to apply a security policy to all repos programmatically?

 Git:

What’s the difference between Git Merge and Rebase?

If someone force-pushed and lost the main branch, how do you recover it?

How to push the recovered branch back to remote?

Company: A growing SaaS startup running its infrastructure on AWS.

Challenge: Cloud bills increased by 40% over six months due to inefficient resource allocation and unnecessary usage.


Issue 1: Over-Provisioned EC2 Instances
    •    The company used large EC2 instances for staging and development, running 24/7.
    •    Many instances were idle during non-business hours.

Solution:
    •    Implemented auto-scaling for production workloads.
    •    Scheduled automatic shutdown of non-production instances during off-hours using AWS Lambda.
    •    Switched to spot instances for non-critical batch processing.

Result: 30% reduction in EC2 costs.


Issue 2: High Log Storage Costs
    •    Application logs were stored in Amazon S3 with no retention policy, leading to terabytes of data.

Solution:
    •    Moved old logs to S3 Glacier for cheaper long-term storage.
    •    Applied lifecycle policies to auto-delete logs older than 90 days.

Result: 50% reduction in log storage costs.


Issue 3: Inefficient CI/CD Pipeline
    •    Every Git commit triggered a full build and test suite, consuming unnecessary compute resources.

Solution:
    •    Modified the pipeline to trigger builds only on changes to specific directories.
    •    Introduced caching for dependencies, reducing build times.
    •    Used self-hosted GitHub runners instead of expensive managed runners.

Result: 40% reduction in CI/CD execution costs.

1
[15:13]
Issue 4: Multiple Load Balancers for Microservices
    •    Each microservice used a separate Load Balancer, significantly increasing monthly billing.

Solution:
    •    Consolidated services behind a single Load Balancer per environment using path-based or host-based routing (for example, using Ingress in GKE or ALB in ECS).

Result: Noticeable cost savings and simplified networking setup.


Issue 5: Unused Container Images in Artifact Registry
    •    No policy was in place to manage old container images in the registry, leading to storage bloat.

Solution:
    •    Created a lifecycle policy in Artifact Registry (or ECR) to automatically delete older, unused images beyond a certain retention threshold.

Result: Reduced storage costs and improved repository hygiene.


Outcome:
After implementing these optimizations, the company reduced its AWS bill by 35% while maintaining performance and reliability.
